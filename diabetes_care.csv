Ketostix Reagent Strips for Urinalysis 50 Strips ,Health,7.95,401553,Ketostix is a Bayer product that is used for ketone detection. It detects ketones from your urine.  Ketostix changes colour depending on the level of ketones found in your urine. Colours range from a beige to deep purple to display level of ketones in your urine.  Ketostix reagent strips for detection of ketones in urine come in packs of 50.,"Ketone testing involves checking how many ketones, or acids are in your blood or urine. Testing for ketones gives an early warning of a medical emergency, called ketoacidosis.   What are Ketones?  Ketones are a type of acid that is left over when your body burns some of its own fat for fuel. Your body burns fat if it can't get enough glucose to use for energy. When your body burns too much fat too quickly, there may be ketones in your blood. Ketones pass from your bloodstream into your urine.  Why Would My Body Have Trouble Using Glucose?  Glucose is the first fuel your body burns for energy. To help move glucose from your bloodstream into body cells for fuel, your body needs insulin. Insulin is a hormone that is made in the pancreas. If there is too little insulin in the bloodstream to help the glucose get into cells, the body looks for other kinds of fuel to burn. When the body burns stored fat, ketones begin to build up in the body. Too many ketones in the bloodstream can lead to a serious problem called ketoacidosis.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/ketostix-reagent-strips-for-urinalysis-50-strips-/401553
Intelligent Texture Protect It - The Worlds Ultimate Sock (White - D 45 - 48) 12124,Intelligent Texture Protect It - The Worlds Ultimate Sock (White - D 45 - 48) 12124,15.00,401657,"If you have at-risk feet due to diabetes or any other condition, the Protect It Sock has been designed  to provide you with the protection, comfort and health that your feet need.","Soft Wide-stretch Top    The cuff of the sock can stretch open wider than 27cm/10"", far more than other socks, helping to avoid leg constriction, even with swollen feet. The cuff includes a special fiber (used nowhere else in the sock) which allows it to grip the leg firmly, yet comfortably, with minimal compression.   Delayed Elastic Recovery     Delayed Elastic Recovery (DER) technology allows the sock to comfortably adapt to your foot and its movements without resistance. Other socks use regular Lycra or elastomeric fibers so that when they are stretched, they resist and immediately stretch back. These can place excessive pressure on the foot, restricting blood circulation and causing skin irritation. PROTECT iT socks’ DER technology is much more advanced: the unique blend of fibers in PROTECT iT socks do not resist when stretched, but instead exhibit delayed elastic recovery. The result is a sock that acts like a “second skin,” which constantly adapts to the shape and movements of each foot.   Unique Fibre Formula     The engineers who created PROTECT iT socks did not compromise on their specifications for the materials used to construct the socks. In fact, they examined and tested hundreds of different cotton fibres until they found those that met their demanding requirements. Furthermore, they designed and manufactured brand new synthetic fibres to suit the special needs of each separate zone of the sock. The world’s finest cotton and only the finest-quality synthetic materials are used in PROTECT iT socks, resulting in a softer, dryer, more protective and more comfortable sock than any other in existence.   Silver Ions Within the Fibres     Both foot odour and infections are the result of bacteria or fungi multiplying on the foot. To combat these microbes, the polymer of the PROTECT iT socks’ synthetic fibres incorporate silver ions (Ag+). These ions disrupt the ability of microbes to multiply, preventing the odor caused by bacteria and fungi on the foot, and eliminating many infections before they start.   Moisture Pump Action     Special dual-layer construction pumps moisture away from the skin, promoting both foot comfort and health. The Moisture Pump Action in PROTECT iT socks is the natural result of the sock’s dual-layer construction: an inside synthetic layer wicks moisture away from the foot, while an outer cotton layer keeps moisture away from the skin and “breathes,” allowing moisture to dissipate and escape away from the foot.   Wrinkle-free Fabric     The unique fabric used in PROTECT iT socks is wrinkle-free and self-straightening such that annoying (and possibly harmful) folds and wrinkles will never appear around the foot. In order to create such a fabric, special composite threads had to be developed with the exact properties required to produce a fabric that would never wrinkle. A proprietary manufacturing method was developed over more than two years especially for PROTECT iT socks in order to yield such threads.     Arch Support with Anti-slip Technology     Arch Support is an elastic anti-slip band around the center of the foot which keeps the sock firmly in place while constantly adapting to the shape and movement of the foot, without undesirable compression. This feature prevents the sock from twisting inside the shoe and from sliding forward towards the toes.   Ventilation Zone     With each step, heat is generated at the bottom of the foot and the heat’s path of least resistance is up through the toes. Thus, the area between the toes is often where bacteria and fungi thrive. In PROTECT iT socks, a mesh-knit ventilation zone stretches across the area above where the toes meet the foot, ventilating this sensitive area in a highly-effective manner. This clearly-visible “air vent” directs moisture up and away from the foot and toes, and prevents it from collecting in areas that could contribute to bacterial growth. This provides excellent moisture dissipation and temperature regulation.   Achilles Tendon Protection     PROTECT iT socks provide extra protection against chafing where the Achilles tendon meets the back of the shoe. This is an important area to protect when breaking in new shoes and for people with sensitive feet.   Y Heel Pocket     PROTECT iT socks’ Y Heel Pocket design locks the sock heel in place using differing thicknesses of material, which align the heel within the sock, while a Y-shaped elastic mechanism gently holds the entire radius of the rear of the sock in place around the heel.   Smooth-inside Seamless Toe     Unlike most socks, which contain a visible protruding seam where the toe area of the sock is sewn closed, PROTECT iT socks feature the ultimate toe closure, which cannot be felt even in tight-fitting shoes. This hand-looped (hand-knitted), ridge-free closure completely eliminates the friction and pressure that other socks inflict on the sensitive toe area.   Multi-zone Construction     Different fibres and different thicknesses in various zones of the sock provide optimum comfort and protection for each area of the foot. Special production techniques had to be designed in order to achieve this highly-complex final product.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/intelligent-texture-protect-it---the-worlds-ultimate-sock-white---d-45---48-12124/401657

A proprietary manufacturing method was developed over more than two years especially for PROTECT iT socks in order to yield such threads.   Arch Support with Anti-slip Technology     Arch Support is an elastic anti-slip band around the center of the foot which keeps the sock firmly in place while constantly adapting to the shape and movement of the foot, without undesirable compression. This feature prevents the sock from twisting inside the shoe and from sliding forward towards the toes.   Ventilation Zone     With each step, heat is generated at the bottom of the foot and the heat’s path of least resistance is up through the toes. Thus, the area between the toes is often where bacteria and fungi thrive. In PROTECT iT socks, a mesh-knit ventilation zone stretches across the area above where the toes meet the foot, ventilating this sensitive area in a highly-effective manner. This clearly-visible “air vent” directs moisture up and away from the foot and toes, and prevents it from collecting in areas that could contribute to bacterial growth. This provides excellent moisture dissipation and temperature regulation.   Achilles Tendon Protection     PROTECT iT socks provide extra protection against chafing where the Achilles tendon meets the back of the shoe. This is an important area to protect when breaking in new shoes and for people with sensitive feet.   Y Heel Pocket     PROTECT iT socks’ Y Heel Pocket design locks the sock heel in place using differing thicknesses of material, which align the heel within the sock, while a Y-shaped elastic mechanism gently holds the entire radius of the rear of the sock in place around the heel.   Smooth-inside Seamless Toe     Unlike most socks, which contain a visible protruding seam where the toe area of the sock is sewn closed, PROTECT iT socks feature the ultimate toe closure, which cannot be felt even in tight-fitting shoes. This hand-looped (hand-knitted), ridge-free closure completely eliminates the friction and pressure that other socks inflict on the sensitive toe area.   Multi-zone Construction     Different fibres and different thicknesses in various zones of the sock provide optimum comfort and protection for each area of the foot. Special production techniques had to be designed in order to achieve this highly-complex final product.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/intelligent-texture-protect-it---the-worlds-ultimate-sock-black---d-45---48-12114/401653

The cuff includes a special fiber (used nowhere else in the sock) which allows it to grip the leg firmly, yet comfortably, with minimal compression.   Delayed Elastic Recovery     Delayed Elastic Recovery (DER) technology allows the sock to comfortably adapt to your foot and its movements without resistance. Other socks use regular Lycra or elastomeric fibers so that when they are stretched, they resist and immediately stretch back. These can place excessive pressure on the foot, restricting blood circulation and causing skin irritation. PROTECT iT socks’ DER technology is much more advanced: the unique blend of fibers in PROTECT iT socks do not resist when stretched, but instead exhibit delayed elastic recovery. The result is a sock that acts like a “second skin,” which constantly adapts to the shape and movements of each foot.   Unique Fibre Formula     The engineers who created PROTECT iT socks did not compromise on their specifications for the materials used to construct the socks. In fact, they examined and tested hundreds of different cotton fibres until they found those that met their demanding requirements. Furthermore, they designed and manufactured brand new synthetic fibres to suit the special needs of each separate zone of the sock. The world’s finest cotton and only the finest-quality synthetic materials are used in PROTECT iT socks, resulting in a softer, dryer, more protective and more comfortable sock than any other in existence.   Silver Ions Within the Fibres     Both foot odour and infections are the result of bacteria or fungi multiplying on the foot. To combat these microbes, the polymer of the PROTECT iT socks’ synthetic fibres incorporate silver ions (Ag+). These ions disrupt the ability of microbes to multiply, preventing the odor caused by bacteria and fungi on the foot, and eliminating many infections before they start.   Moisture Pump Action     Special dual-layer construction pumps moisture away from the skin, promoting both foot comfort and health. The Moisture Pump Action in PROTECT iT socks is the natural result of the sock’s dual-layer construction: an inside synthetic layer wicks moisture away from the foot, while an outer cotton layer keeps moisture away from the skin and “breathes,” allowing moisture to dissipate and escape away from the foot.
