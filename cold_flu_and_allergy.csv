Prevalin Allergy Adult Nasal Spray 20ml,Health,11.95,400252,"Prevalin Allergy Nasal Spray works by creating a barrier on the nasal lining.  Instead of treating hay fever symptoms once they have set in, Prevalin tackles the root cause of hay fever before full blown symptoms even occur. With its unique approach, Prevalin lines the inside of the nose, deactivating pollen and getting to the root of the problem - addressing all significant hay fever symptoms, without the side-effects.  Prevalin allergy nasal spray is a unique formulation that changes from a gel to liquid state easily after shaking; this makes it easier to spray into the nose",Prevalin relieves the symptoms of hay fever in the nose and eyes without causing side effects.  Once shaken Prevalin becomes a liquid that can be easily sprayed into the nose. It then forms a stable and impermeable microgel barrier blocking the allergens from irritating the nasal mucosa and causing symptoms.  Prevalin's triple action formula ensures an effective treatment preventing pollen from irritating the mast cells and releasing histamines:  Prevalin's patented formula contains specific ingredients that uniquely deactivate pollen in the nose so it cannot irritate the nasal mucosa.  Prevalin's microgel formula then forms an impermeable layer on the mucosa for protection against pollen irritation.  Prevalin also stimulates the clearance of pollen from the body.,,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/prevalin-allergy-adult-nasal-spray-20ml/400252

In-Salin Salt Pipe Mini Inhaler,"Health->Cold, Flu & Allergy->Salt Therapy & Air Purifiers",28.95,401515,"With this salt pipe inhaler from Salin Plus, significant therapeutic effects may be obtained in different conditions of the upper and lower respiratory tracts, such as asthma, alleries, sinusitis and rhinitis.","The salt pipe uses an absolutely innovative process based on forcing the air breathed in by its user through a layer of granular salt with a controlled structure.  A  lightweight ""pocket"" device, for all time use, so it can be used before, during or after exposing to environmental conditions. At school, at the gym, at work, on a plane, in crowded places, there are many situations where  InSalin  could be of a real help.  The salt pipe is the complementary product to the Salin Plus salt therapy device, which is mainly used at night. This gives you the chance to get even more exposure to the salt therapy, maximising the beneficial results.  InSalin  is filled with halite salt crystals formed in the Middle Miocene era from the Transylvanian Praid salt mine, same rock salt that we use in the other salt therapy devices.   When the air produced by this device is breathed in, the salt micro-particles enter the upper and lower respiratory tracts where they dissolve in the outer layer of the mucus covering the respiratory epithelium. The saline micro-particles physically act on the soft liquid layer covering the respiratory tracts, by modifying the superficial tension and viscosity. The mucus becomes more fluid and it is easily mobilized by the vibrating cilia of the respiratory epithelial cells, in order to be eliminated at the pharyngeal level, by ameliorating the mucociliary clearance.  We recommend a daily use of this device, 10-15 inhalations, respectively 1-1.5 minutes/2-3 times per day. However, there is no limit regarding the daily number of utilizations. The daily amount of salt breathed in at a normal use is under 0.05 g.  The salt pipe offers a complementary treatment, which does not replace the current medical treatments.  No refill or replacement are required   Chemical composition of salt crystal: NaCl 98.64%, CaSO4 1.11%, MgCl2 0.02%, CaCl2 0.17%, further traces of insoluble substances and humidity.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/in-salin-salt-pipe-mini-inhaler/401515

Salin Plus Breathe Easy Salt Therapy,"Health->Cold, Flu & Allergy->Salt Therapy & Air Purifiers",148.95,200087,"Salin Plus is a revolutionary salt therapy for home use. Salin Plus may improve the quality of life for sufferers of asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, C.O.P.D and many other respiratory and allergy conditions, including sinusitis, sleep apnea, tuberculosis, silicosis and laryngitis.","Salin®  uses a new and unique method in an advanced process for treating air. The process works as follows: air is forced through the filter which contains a micro-crystallized deposit of salts, primarily sodium chloride (98 % NaCl, 0.5 % calcium chloride and magnesium, 0.2 % iodine and sulphur).  The  Salin®  Air Purifier works by having air constantly passing through the filter with micro-crystalline salts which creates a fine, constant spry of sodium chloride in the surrounding area, changing the ionization of the air.   The structure of the device is compact and consists of a special filter made from microcrystalline sediment and a bellows mechanism. The device is easy to use and it ensures general purification of the air in different types of areas: room, apartments, offices, even car. Use is recommended mainly at night so as to ensure minimum exposure to the environment of 8 hours a day. If necessary, exposure can be extended to the whole day. One device is adequate for the treatment of max.150 cubic meters (about 55 sq meters). The device has no corrosive effect on the environment it treats.  It is recommended to use on a higher setting for the first month of use, before adjusting to a maintenence setting that suits you.  It is not recommended to use the device  Salin®  in spaces with high humidity or steam, in dusty spaces or in spaces with oily aerosols (kitchen), because these kinds of environments damage the filter.  It is recommended to replace the Salin Plus filters after approximately 4 months of use each night, this is to ensure you get the most from your slat therapy treatment. The unit comes fitted with one Salin Plus filter included. Salin Plus Salt Therapy is not indicated to replace your current medication.
