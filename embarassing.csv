Bio-Oil,Mother & Baby->Pregnancy Care->Stretch Marks,7.50 - 17.95,P-300060,"Bio   Oil  for scars, stretch marks and dehydrated skin Bio Oil is an award winning specialist skincare product that helps improve the appearance of scars, stretch marks and uneven skin tone. Also it is highly effective for ageing and dehydrated skin. Bio Oil is a non-comedogenic, (acnegenic) hypo-allergenic product that is suitable for use by individual with sensitive skin. Bio Oil has won 183 skincare awards and has become the No. 1 selling scar and stretch mark product. Results vary from individual to individual.","Bio Oil helps reduces the appearance of all types of scars. Bio Oil should be applied only once the wound has healed and should never be used on broken skin. Older scars will benefit from regular use of Bio-Oil whilst younger scars have a greater chance of improvement over a shorter time. Bio Oil is formulated to help reduce the appearance of scars but it will never remove them entirely.  How to use Bio Oil on scars? Massage a few drops of Bio Oil in a circular motion into the scar and surrounding skin, twice daily, for a minimum of 3 months usage.  Bio Oil helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Sagging and wrinkled skin commonly associated with aging is largely caused by the weakening of the collagen and elastin support system in the dermis. Bio-Oil contains numerous ingredients that help to plasticize the skin, making it softer, smoother and more supple, thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkled and sagging skin. Bio-Oil also moisturizes, which improves the texture, tone and appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  Bio Oil should be applied twice daily to the ageing skin.  Bio Oil helps improve the appearance of stretch marks. Stretch marks appear when the body expands faster than the covering skin, which causes the skin to tear and when the skin heals it scars, it is this scar which is known as stretch marks.  Stretch marks are permanent in nature, and although Bio Oil is formulated to help improve their appearance, it will never remove them. Bio Oil is highly effective in helping to improve the appearance of existing stretch marks as it increases the elasticity of the skin and the reduces the possibility of new stretch marks forming.  Those most prone to stretch marks include pregnant women, body builders, adolescents undergoing sudden growth spurts and individuals who experience rapid weight gain.  Using Bio Oil during pregnancy Bio Oil should be massaged in a circular motion into the stretch marks, twice daily, for a minimum of 3 months. During pregnancy, it should be applied from the start of the second trimester to areas that are prone to stretch marks such as the abdomen, breasts, lower back, hips, buttocks and thighs.","How to use  Bio   Oil  on scars Massage a few drops of  Bio   Oil  in a circular motion into the scar and surrounding skin, twice daily, for a minimum of 3 months usage. Bio Oil should be applied twice daily as a moisturiser Bio Oil can help with dehydrated skin and dry skin. If the main cause of dehydrated skin is lack of water intake, then first you need to increase your water intake. Hydration is important because no amount of treatment will help if you do not take on enough water. Bio Oil supplements the skins natural oil layer and helps to restore its barrier function of retaining moisture. Bio Oil is a hypo allergic product.",,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/bio-oil/p-300060

This will help you determine the most appropriate treatment option.","How To Use Canestest      1: Remove the Canestest swab from the wrapping. Make sure the swab tip does not come into contact with anything before you insert it into your vagina.  2: Hold the Canestest swab by the handle and insert the yellow tip into your vagina, rotate the swab and then remove.         3:  After 10 seconds check the tip of the Canestest swab to see if the colour has stayed the same or changed to blue or green.     If your Canestest swab didn’t change colour after 10 seconds, it means that you may be suffering from thrush. If you have symptoms such as an itchy or sore vagina, or thick, white discharge, it’s likely that this is the case.  How To Read Your Canestest Results  No colour change in swab after 10 seconds : If you have symptoms such as an itchy or sore vagina, or thick, white discharge, it’s likely that you may be suffering from thrush.  Colour change of the swab to blue or green: A) If you also have  symptoms such as a thin, grey discharge and an unpleasant fishy smell, you are likely to have a BV ( bacterial vaginosis). BV is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria regularly found in your vagina and is  easily treated.  B)  If you also have symptoms such as  unusual yellow-green discharge with an unpleasant odour and a vulvar itch, it is possible you may have  Trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease.

CB12 Mild Mint Mouthwash 250ml,Health,8.95,200001,"CB12 is a new, unique, long-lasting mouth rinse proven to prevent and neutralise bad breath for up to 12 hours.","CB12 is a new, unique, long-lasting mouth rinse proven to prevent and neutralise bad breath. CB12 neutralises the substances and processes that cause bad breath by combating all three ‘volatile sulphur compounds’ (VSC) gases that cause bad breath instead of simply masking the smell for a short period of time. The unique combination of Zinc and Chlorhexidine in CB12 targets the ‘VSCs’ from exhaled air and neutralises bad breath. CB12 also contains fluoride to help prevent tooth decay.   Chlorhexidine diacetate breaks down the complex VSC gases that cause the distinctive bad breath smell, while helping to coat the oral cavity for all-day protection. Zinc acetate then neutralises these sulphurous gases and turns them into harmless, odourless compounds. The result is a better and more lasting effect against bad breath, with 12 hours of instant, safe breath confidence for you.  What is bad breath?  Bad breath is a common problem that affects men and women of all ages. It develops when naturally occurring bacteria on the teeth, gums and tongue combine with saliva and food in the mouth to start the digestive process. This bacteria breaks down food particles and proteins, producing unpleasant smelling gases that can cause bad breath.    What causes bad breath?  Bad breath can have several causes, but in most cases it happens when bacteria in the mouth break down bits of food. This produces sulphurous gases that cause bad breath. CB12 neutralises and prevents the formation of these gases, without killing the bacteria that are a normal part of digestion.  How can I tell if I have bad breath  It can be really hard to know if you have bad breath. Other people usually notice it first, but they may find it difficult to let you know. If you’re not comfortable asking a close friend or family member to check your breath, you can try this simple test.   Lick the inside of your wrist.  Wait for the saliva to dry.  If it smells unpleasant, it’s likely you have bad breath.   What can I do about it?  Good oral hygiene is the first defence against bad breath. Twice daily brushing, flossing, and regular visits to your dentist and hygienist can sometimes be enough to prevent and treat bad breath. Things like mints, gum and mouth wash can also help temporarily, but they may simply mask the smell for short periods of time rather than tackle the cause of bad breath.",Rinse for approx. 30 sec. to 1 min. Gargle and then spit out. Do not swallow. Suitable for adults and children over 12 years of age,"Contains 0.05% sodium fluoride.
