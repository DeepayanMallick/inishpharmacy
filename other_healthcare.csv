Ear Band-it Ultra,Health->Other Healthcare->Ear Care,22.95,P-401327,"The original swimmer's headband, designed to hold ear plugs or ear molds in place while engaging in water activities.   Extra durable 3ml neoprene with adustable Velcro type closure.  Ear Band-It's unique design offers ultimate comfort and protection for the ears.  Colours may vary, if there is a specific colour you require please contact us at time of order.","Is the Ear Band-It waterproof?  No, neoprene is not a waterproof material, although it will keep the majority of water out of the ear canal.  The purpose of the band it to hold ear plugs or ear molds in place to form a watertight system.  The Ear Band-It should not be worn by itself if the intent is to prevent water from entering the ear canal.  How long will the Ear Band-It last?  The answer to this question depends on usage.  With heavy usage, the band may last approximately two years.  Some people are still using bands that are five years old!  The usual reason for ordering a new band is the fading of color.  The ear plugs may become dirty or tacky after three weeks with heavy usage, or last quite a bit longer with light usage.  Can you dive with the Ear Band-It?  We do not recommend diving head first with the Ear Band-It® as the band may come off the head.  The band will float, however, for easy retrieval.  Swimming and jumping in the water feet first are not a problem.  Will my child be compliant in wearing the Ear Band-It?  Every child is different, of course, but most children enjoy wearing the Ear Band-It®.  The band comes in five assorted, bright and attractive colors to please even the most selective of children.  Given the option of not swimming at all, or perhaps wearing an unsightly bathing cap, most children jump at the chance to wear the Ear Band-It®.  We've heard many stories of children still wearing the band even after their ear problem is resolved.  Is the Ear Band-It® safe to wear?  The Ear Band-It ear protection system was developed and patented over 10 years ago by a board certified otolaryngologist (Ear, Nose and Throat physician) in response to the lack of a practical way to allow people with ear problems to swim and bathe safely.  The band is specifically designed to avoid slippage during normal water activities and keep ear protection devices solidly placed over the ear canal.  Hundreds of thousands of satisified children and adults have purchased the Ear Band-It over the years and the product is recommended by otolaryngologists and audiologists around the world.  Does the Ear Band-It float?  The Ear Band-It does float, but ear plugs in general do not.   Can you use Ear Band-It for bathing and showering?  Absolutely!  The Ear Band-It is excellent for swimming, bathing, showering and keeping your ears warm.  Are you able to swim/bathe with a hearing aid if wearing the Ear Band-It?  No.  The Ear Band-It is not waterproof.  Your hearing aid may become wet and damaged if your only protection is the Ear Band-It.  Do you need to wash the Ear Band-It?  No.  The Ear Band-It will stay clean from the chlorinated pool, bathtub or shower.  If you feel the need to wash the band or it becomes stained, we recommend hand washing and air drying.  Are you able to hear while wearing the Ear Band-It?  Yes, although you will not hear as well as you would with nothing covering your ears.  The ear plugs are the limiting factor here, as neoprene does not significantly impair hearing.  Is the Ear Band-It comfortable to wear?  The Ear Band-It is very comfortable to wear and loved by both kids and adults.  The Ear Band-It is made of neoprene, the stretchy material used to make wet suits.  Additionally, the band comes in three different sizes and may be adjusted with a three inch Velcro type closure in the back.  This flexibility enables the Ear Band-It to fit comfortably on all head sizes.    Where to measure the head for the correct fit?  Measure from the hairline in front across the ears to the hairline in the back (I.e. downward angle). Use a cloth tape measure if you have one or use a string and the measure from the string. Be sure to not pinch the tape or string together as this will create extra length. You should wrap the tape or sting around the head and note where they intersect.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/ear-band-it-ultra/p-401327
