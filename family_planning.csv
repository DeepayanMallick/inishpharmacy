This is done by indicating a sudden surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) in your body with a simple urine test. LH is the hormone that triggers the release of an egg from your ovary, which is also known as ovulation and generally occurs 24 to 36 hours after the LH increase.  If you use it each day on the days around the time in your cycle when you expect the LH surge, you can predict the 2 days each cycle when you are most fertile and therefore most likely to get pregnant.  Clearblue Digital Ovulation Tests have been shown in extensive laboratory trials to be over 99% accurate in detecting the LH surge before ovulation.  Fertility is at its highest the day the LH surge is detected and the day after. You are most likely to get pregnant if you have sex on these days. Clearblue Digital Ovulation Tests detect this LH surge, and therefore maximize your chances of conceiving.   The results are fast, clear and easy to understand, with a smiley face indicating a LH surge.  Your results are available after 3 minutes.",,,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/clearblue-digital-ovulation-test-/p-401513

Maybe Baby Saliva Ovulation Tester - 1 RE-USABLE Test,Health,48.95,200056,"Maybe Baby allows you know 2-3 days in advance when you are going to ovulate to help maximise your chances of getting pregnant.  Maybe Baby is re-usable and 98% accurate. It is compact, just the size of a lipstick making it discreet and portable. Maybe Baby is also a non-invasive, chemical free product and the results can be seen in 10-15 minutes.","Maybe Baby ™ is a mini-microscope that helps you identify the fertile period in which you can become pregnant. This Ovulation Test works by identifying the patterns that occur in dried saliva caused by oestrogen levels increasing during the period around ovulation. As the saliva dries, high levels of oestrogen cause a fern-leaf pattern to develop, and this pattern can be seen easily through the Maybe Baby ™ microscope.  As you know every woman’s body is different, and many of us don’t have exact 28 ovulation cycles. As Maybe Baby ™ is 98% accurate if it is used correctly it will be able to help you to pinpoint the most fertile period of the reproductive cycle and therefore help maximise the possibility for a successful pregnancy. We feel that it is important to use Maybe Baby consistently and chart your results for a few months so that you can get a clear picture of your own unique cycle pattern.  Maybe Baby ™ lets you know 2-3 days in advance when you are going to ovulate which will also help to maximise your chances of pregnancy.  Maybe Baby ™ is simple, 98% accurate and is re-usable. It is lipstick sized which means it is discreet and portable. Maybe Baby™ is also a non-invasive, chemical free product and the results can be seen in 10-15 minutes.  The Maybe Baby ™ microscope magnifies your saliva. This in turn allows you to see when oestrogen levels are high. Therefore anything that affects oestrogen levels in the body, such as medications, infections, breastfeeding and pregnancy will affect the results. If you have naturally high or low oestrogen levels your Maybe Baby ™ reading may also be affected.","STEP 1 Please ensure that you have  not  had anything to eat or drink ( including chewing gum, cigarettes, food, mouthwash, toothpaste, and drinks)  for at least 3 hours before using Maybe Baby. The only exception to this is water. This is recommended as anything that touches your saliva besides water may affect your saliva and prevent an accurate reading. The most convenient time to use it maybe first thing in the morning. STEP 2 Remove the protective cover.    STEP 3 Pull the black viewfinder straight out from its case (do not try to unscrew it).    STEP 4 Clean the viewfinder with the lint-free cloth. The  eyepiece/lens, on  the outside is the part you look through and the inside is the flat glass surface (the slide) where you place your saliva. Gently rub the cloth across the flat glass surface. You may need to moisten the slide with a bit of saliva before use. Please only use saliva and a lint-free cloth like the one provided as water or other cleaning products may damage the microscope.   STEP 5 With clean hands, use your fingertip to lightly place a dab of saliva on the flat internal glass surface on the inside of the viewfinder.    STEP 6 Allow saliva dry for approx 10 minutes as indication of oestrogen in the saliva will only appear in a dry saliva sample. If the saliva is not dry after 15 minutes, you have used a bit too much; if it dries in under 5 minutes, you have not used enough. Keep track of time and do not allow your saliva to sit for more than 15 minutes as you may not get an accurate reading. STEP 7 Place the view finder back onto the microscope.   STEP 8 Hold in the light switch on the bottom of the microscope  continuously   while you look through the lens. STEP 9 Holding the eyepiece up close to your eye, look through the lens. STEP 10 Turn the black focussing ring on the viewfinder t o focus the image until the picture appears sharp.   STEP 11 The patterns should be very apparent. They will be translucent or greyish against the green background. STEP 12 It is recommend that you use an ovulation-monitoring chart to monitor your Maybe Baby results daily. This  will help you become more familiar with your own ovulation cycle and allow you to build a personal ovulation calendar. Over time, this will help you predict your most fertile period each month.  *See attached chart with results details.",,https://www.inishpharmacy.com/p/maybe-baby-saliva-ovulation-tester---1-re-usable-test/200056
