This will help you determine the most appropriate treatment option.","How To Use Canestest      1: Remove the Canestest swab from the wrapping. Make sure the swab tip does not come into contact with anything before you insert it into your vagina.  2: Hold the Canestest swab by the handle and insert the yellow tip into your vagina, rotate the swab and then remove.         3:  After 10 seconds check the tip of the Canestest swab to see if the colour has stayed the same or changed to blue or green.     If your Canestest swab didn’t change colour after 10 seconds, it means that you may be suffering from thrush. If you have symptoms such as an itchy or sore vagina, or thick, white discharge, it’s likely that this is the case.  How To Read Your Canestest Results  No colour change in swab after 10 seconds : If you have symptoms such as an itchy or sore vagina, or thick, white discharge, it’s likely that you may be suffering from thrush.  Colour change of the swab to blue or green: A) If you also have  symptoms such as a thin, grey discharge and an unpleasant fishy smell, you are likely to have a BV ( bacterial vaginosis). BV is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria regularly found in your vagina and is  easily treated.  B)  If you also have symptoms such as  unusual yellow-green discharge with an unpleasant odour and a vulvar itch, it is possible you may have  Trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease. Treatment is available on prescription by your GP.","1: Remove the Canestest swab from the wrapping.
